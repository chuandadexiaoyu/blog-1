# What does this picture mean?

Recently, [Dominic Tarr][0] asked me why I used this image (seen at the left, 
but not on mobile) for my blog. I can't remember where I found this image. 
But it spoke to me. Here is the full image.

![When it's time, it's time](img/pictures/whenitstimeitstime.jpeg)

These skeletons are paradoxical. Both alive and dead. The one in the center I 
find really expressive. His emotional posture animated and then captured in 
time. He bears an implement, a shovel perhaps. I'm assuming him a laborer. He 
also appears to be lamenting some aspect of his abstract reality.

My interpretation of this image felt like an interesting analog for working 
with software. Software has a short life expectancy. And many times, once it 
has come to maturity it can be thrown away in favor of something newer and 
better. Despite this, an engineer crafts intricate work in the same way a 
Tibetan monk creates a [sand paining][1], only to throw it away.
